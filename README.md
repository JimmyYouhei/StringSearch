# StringSearch
##	Introduction 
This is my implementation for 2 common String Searching Algorithms: Naive Search , Boyer-Moore-Horspool Search
##	Version: 
-	It is written by using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.1.3 x64
-	JDK version 11
##	How to install:
If you use IntelliJ IDEA use new -> Project From Version Control -> Git and paste https://github.com/JimmyYouhei/StringSearch.git
##	How to use: 
-	Using the Main class to run any custom command (I have included some example command)
-	StringSearching interface is fully written with method: 
    -	naiveSearch(String toFind , String toSearchFrom): find the toFind String from toSearchFrom String using naive search method 
    -	boyerMooreHorspool(String toFind , String toSearchFrom): like above but using the boyerMooreHorsool search method
##	Note:
-	Due to the class is written purely for learning purpose so very little Exception handle is expected 
-	I knew that there are many other algorithms . However due to time constraint and I had to move on. As a result, only the above algorithms are implemented. And others maybe added later
